# CS207-Bubble-Machine
This Repository is Designated for the Final project of CS-207 - Building interactive Gadgets.
This projects is a an automated Robot that blows bubbles when turned on, it uses 2 Servos and 5 DC Motors with Fans attached, all this is 
programmed using the Arduino Uno.

The Robot works by having the two servos one has a ring attached to it that goes up and down to dip the ring in the soapy water,
while the other servo moves to position the ring infront of the DC motor for it to make the bubbles.
